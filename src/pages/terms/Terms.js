                    entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
                    exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not
                    operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal Terms operate to
                    the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights
                    and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable
                    for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our
                    reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Legal
                    Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or
                    part of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not

                    of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defences you may have
